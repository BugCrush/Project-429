#### This progress report outlines the challenges encountered by conventional registration booths set up by colleges / corporations during events for attendee detail collection and brings out the need for having simpler solutions such as Project 429, an idea that we, the developers, envision to be implemented out as a one-stop solution to eliminate all problem statements. A Near Field Communication (NFC) device creates a medium for small yet valuable information to traverse easily from device to device. Such small bits of information may be used in processing in payments, automatic storage of contacts, security alarms and many more. Project 429 makes use of this ‘medium’ and links hardware and software so as to create a well encrypted system only accessible by specific non-rewritable NFC tag owners that makes the process of registrations and payments fast as well as safe by omitting the probabilities of identity theft and unauthorised entries into events. The product capitalizes on the use of basic NFC tags to make things easier for registering people for various events. These tags contain the necessary information of an attendee so as to process information for payments and event registration that can be accessed by just scanning the assigned tag which is the form of a card (preferable), ring or a bracelet. At its maximum capacity, the ideals of a contact-less and digital technological environment are also viable.

### Instructions:

1. `git clone https://github.com/BugCrush/Project-429.git`

    > clones the repository into your desired directory

2. `cd Project-429`

    > takes your terminal into the root directory for further instructions

### Contributions:

1. Always pull before a push using `git pull origin main`
2. Every commit must include only one change or one feature.
3. Add files using `git add -A` to add all files or `git add filename.extension` for adding an individual file.
4. Commit using `git commit -M "message"` where the message must be simple and clear, or commit using VSCode.
5. Push using `git push origin main`.
